# Now look at the VIF for each predictor

## Manual calculation of VIF for education 

mrm_educ <- lm(educ~ exper+tenure, wage1)

R2_educ  <- summary(mrm_educ)$r.squared

(vif_educ <- 1/(1-R2_educ))



mrm_exper <- lm(exper~educ+tenure,wage1)
R2_exper  <- summary(mrm_exper)$r.squared
(vif_exper <- 1/(1-R2_exper))


# find the VIF_tenure
